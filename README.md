Extension of Google Mirror API's Quickstart for Java
========================

This is an extension for the intentionally feature-light Quickstart for Java project.

It adds buttons to:

* add a video as an attachment to the timeline
* add an animated gif as an attachment to the timeline (display on Glass is broken as of XE6--workaround included as of 6/11/13))


The documentation for original quickstart is maintained on developers.google.com.
